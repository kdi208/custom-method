Detailed Implementation Plan: Automated A/B Testing with LLM Agents (AGENTA/B Methodology)
Objective: To execute a scalable, automated A/B test by simulating user behavior with LLM-powered agents, following the framework established by the AGENTA/B research paper.

Phase 1: Foundation & Asset Preparation (Largely Complete)
Task 1.1: Create Personas (10)
Details: You have created 10 distinct user personas. Each persona should be a rich description including demographics (age, profession, income), background, shopping habits, personal style, and professional life, similar to the "Marcus" example in the research. These details are not just for flavor; they will be fed directly to the LLM to influence its behavior.
Status: ✅ Complete
Task 1.2: Create Intentions (4)
Details: You have created 4 specific user intentions. An intention is a clear, goal-oriented task that a persona will attempt to achieve. This is the primary driver of the agent's actions.
Example Intention: "Search for a waterproof running jacket under $150, read at least two reviews, and add the highest-rated one to the cart."
Action: For each of your 10 personas, assign one of the 4 intentions. You can assign them randomly or in a structured way to ensure a good mix. This pairing of a Persona + Intention creates a unique "virtual user" for your test.
Status: ✅ Complete
Phase 2: Experiment Design & Configuration (New & Critical Prerequisite)
Before any integration, you must formally design the experiment.

Task 2.1: Define the A/B Test Hypothesis
Details: State clearly what you are testing and what you expect to happen. This is the central question your test will answer.
Example Hypothesis: "The redesigned, single-page checkout process (Treatment) will lead to a 15% higher purchase completion rate compared to the current multi-page checkout process (Control)."
Task 2.2: Prepare the Control and Treatment Environments
Details: You need two distinct, fully functional, and live web environments for the agents to interact with.
Control (Group A): The existing, unchanged version of your webpage/feature.
Treatment (Group B): The new version you want to test.
Requirement: Both versions must be accessible via a URL or be programmatically launchable for the automation tools.
Task 2.3: Define Key Behavioral Metrics to Track
Details: Decide exactly what you will measure to prove or disprove your hypothesis. The AGENTA/B paper tracked several metrics, including:
Primary Metric: Purchase Completion Rate (# of purchases / # of sessions).
Secondary Metrics:
Average Actions per Session (to measure efficiency).
Session Duration (in time).
Clicks on specific elements (e.g., Click_filter_option, Click_product).
Failure Rate (sessions that did not complete the intention).
Average Spend ($).
Phase 3: LLM Agent Integration & Agentic Automation (Revised)
This phase is now significantly streamlined. You are no longer building the interaction modules; you are configuring and orchestrating the agent.

Task 3.1: Set Up the Claude Computer-Use Agentic Framework
Details: This is your new starting point for implementation. You need an "Agent Runner" environment that allows Claude to control a web browser. This involves using an official Anthropic SDK or a compatible open-source framework (e.g., Open Interpreter configured to use Claude's API).
Action:
Choose Your Tool: Research and select the framework that will connect Claude's API to your operating system's controls.
Environment Setup: Create a dedicated, controlled environment (like a virtual machine or Docker container) where the agent will run.
Grant Permissions: Configure the necessary permissions for the agentic framework to take screenshots, control the mouse, and use the keyboard.
Browser Instance: Prepare a clean, automated browser instance (e.g., a specific Chrome profile) for the agent to use.
Task 3.2: Design the Agent's Operational Prompt
Details: Your prompt is now less about structured data and more about providing context, goals, and guiding the agent's reasoning process. The model will receive a screenshot/accessibility tree of the screen directly from the framework.
Action: Construct a master prompt template for the Claude API call that includes:
System Role: "You are an expert UX tester. Your task is to role-play a specific user persona and complete a given task on a website. You will be given a screenshot of the current page. Think step-by-step about your observation, reasoning, and the next action you will take. Then, output the single command to execute."
Persona Information: Inject the full text of the persona.
User Intention: Inject the specific, high-level goal.
Action History: Maintain a running list of the high-level actions the agent has already taken.
Key Difference: You are no longer providing a JSON of the page. The agent "sees" the screen for itself. Your prompt guides its interpretation of what it sees.
Task 3.3: Execute and Monitor the Simulation Loop
Details: This task replaces both the "Parser" and "Executor" modules from the previous plan. The loop is now orchestrated by your chosen Agent Runner.
The New Loop:
Observe: The Agent Runner captures the current screen state (e.g., a screenshot).
Decide: The runner calls the Claude API with the screenshot and your operational prompt.
Act: Claude returns a specific computer-use command (e.g., click(label="Add to Cart"), type("waterproof running jacket", into="Search Bar")).
Execute: The Agent Runner executes this command directly on the OS.
Log: This is critical. Log every step: the screenshot provided to the model, the full prompt, the agent's entire thought process (if available), the final command executed, and the time taken.
Repeat: The loop continues until the agent outputs a stop() command upon completing its intention or a failure condition is met.

Task 4.1: Aggregate and Analyze Data
Details: Process the detailed logs from your simulation run.
Action: Write scripts to calculate the key metrics (from Task 2.3) for both the control and treatment groups.
Task 4.2: Compare Group Performance & Validate Hypothesis
Details: Use statistical methods to determine if the differences between Group A and Group B are significant.
Action: Compare the metrics. Did the treatment group have a higher purchase rate? Was it statistically significant (e.g., using a chi-squared test as in the paper)? This step validates or invalidates your initial hypothesis.
Task 4.3: [Optional but Recommended] Benchmark Against Human Behavior
Details: The ultimate validation is comparing the simulation to reality.
Action: Compare the behavior of your control group agents to existing analytics data for real users on your site. Don't look for a perfect match. Look for directional consistency. Do agents click on the same types of things as humans? Is their user journey plausible? This helps build confidence in your simulation's fidelity.
Phase 5: Finalizing Customer Profiles & Planning Next Steps
This re-frames your final point into a forward-looking action.

Task 5.1: Create Finalized Customer Profiles
Details: Your initial personas were theoretical. Now they have behavioral data attached to them.
Action: Archive the results by persona. You can now say, "When we give a 'Marcus-like' persona an intention to buy a tech gadget, they tend to use the search bar 3 times and rarely use filters." This turns your personas into data-backed Customer Profiles. These profiles become invaluable assets for designing future tests without needing to run them.
Task 5.2: Iterate or Deploy
Details: Based on the validated results of your A/B test, make a decision.
Action: If the treatment was a clear winner, plan for its deployment to real users. If the results were inconclusive or negative, use the insights from the agent behavior to design a new, improved "Version C" and plan your next simulation.

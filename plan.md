Detailed Implementation Plan: Automated A/B Testing with LLM Agents (AGENTA/B Methodology)
Objective: To execute a scalable, automated A/B test by simulating user behavior with LLM-powered agents, following the framework established by the AGENTA/B research paper.

Phase 1: Foundation & Asset Preparation (Largely Complete)
Task 1.1: Create Personas (10)
Details: You have created 10 distinct user personas. Each persona should be a rich description including demographics (age, profession, income), background, shopping habits, personal style, and professional life, similar to the "Marcus" example in the research. These details are not just for flavor; they will be fed directly to the LLM to influence its behavior.
Status: ✅ Complete
Task 1.2: Create Intentions (4)
Details: You have created 4 specific user intentions. An intention is a clear, goal-oriented task that a persona will attempt to achieve. This is the primary driver of the agent's actions.
Example Intention: "Search for a waterproof running jacket under $150, read at least two reviews, and add the highest-rated one to the cart."
Action: For each of your 10 personas, assign one of the 4 intentions. You can assign them randomly or in a structured way to ensure a good mix. This pairing of a Persona + Intention creates a unique "virtual user" for your test.
Status: ✅ Complete
Phase 2: Experiment Design & Configuration (New & Critical Prerequisite)
Before any integration, you must formally design the experiment.

Task 2.1: Define the A/B Test Hypothesis
Details: State clearly what you are testing and what you expect to happen. This is the central question your test will answer.
Example Hypothesis: "The redesigned, single-page checkout process (Treatment) will lead to a 15% higher purchase completion rate compared to the current multi-page checkout process (Control)."
Task 2.2: Prepare the Control and Treatment Environments
Details: You need two distinct, fully functional, and live web environments for the agents to interact with.
Control (Group A): The existing, unchanged version of your webpage/feature.
Treatment (Group B): The new version you want to test.
Requirement: Both versions must be accessible via a URL or be programmatically launchable for the automation tools.
Task 2.3: Define Key Behavioral Metrics to Track
Details: Decide exactly what you will measure to prove or disprove your hypothesis. The AGENTA/B paper tracked several metrics, including:
Primary Metric: Purchase Completion Rate (# of purchases / # of sessions).
Secondary Metrics:
Average Actions per Session (to measure efficiency).
Session Duration (in time).
Clicks on specific elements (e.g., Click_filter_option, Click_product).
Failure Rate (sessions that did not complete the intention).
Average Spend ($).
Phase 3: LLM Agent Integration and Automated Interaction
This phase corresponds to your "Integrate Claude Computer Use" step but is broken down into the core components of the AGENTA/B architecture.

Task 3.1: Develop the Environment Parsing Module
Details: An LLM cannot "see" a webpage. This module's job is to translate the live webpage's HTML/DOM into a simplified, structured format (like JSON) that the LLM can understand.
Action: Write a script using a tool like Selenium or Playwright with BeautifulSoup or ChromeDriver's JavaScript execution to:
Extract all interactable elements (buttons, links, input fields, filters).
Assign a unique ID to each element (e.g., button_1, product_5).
Extract key text content (product titles, prices, descriptions).
Package this into a clean JSON object representing the current state of the page.
Task 3.2: Configure the LLM Agent (The "Claude" Decision-Making Module)
Details: This is the brain of the operation. For each step in the simulation, you will make an API call to Claude.
Action: Construct a detailed prompt for the Claude API that includes:
System Prompt: "You are a helpful assistant simulating a user on a website. Your goal is to act according to the provided persona and complete the user's intention."
Persona Information: Inject the full text of the persona (e.g., "You are Marcus...").
User Intention: Inject the specific goal (e.g., "Your goal is to find a running jacket...").
Current Page State: Provide the JSON output from the Environment Parsing Module.
Action History: List the sequence of actions already taken in the session.
Available Actions: Explicitly list the actions the agent can take (e.g., search("text"), click("element_id"), purchase(), stop()).
Expected Output: The LLM's response should be a single, structured command, like {"action": "click", "element": "product_5"}.
Task 3.3: Build the Action Execution Module
Details: This module takes the LLM's chosen action and executes it in the live web browser.
Action: Write a function that parses the LLM's JSON output and uses Selenium/Playwright to perform the corresponding browser command (e.g., driver.find_element(By.ID, 'product_5').click()).
Crucial Feature: Implement fault detection and recovery logic as described in the paper. If an element isn't found, retry, scroll it into view, or re-parse the page.
Task 3.4: Run the Full Simulation Loop
Details: Combine the above modules into a loop that runs for each of your virtual users until their intention is met or a failure condition (e.g., too many steps) is reached. Log every single action, page state, and LLM rationale.
Phase 4: Analysis & Validation of Testing Results
This is your "Validate Testing Results" step, made concrete.

Task 4.1: Aggregate and Analyze Data
Details: Process the detailed logs from your simulation run.
Action: Write scripts to calculate the key metrics (from Task 2.3) for both the control and treatment groups.
Task 4.2: Compare Group Performance & Validate Hypothesis
Details: Use statistical methods to determine if the differences between Group A and Group B are significant.
Action: Compare the metrics. Did the treatment group have a higher purchase rate? Was it statistically significant (e.g., using a chi-squared test as in the paper)? This step validates or invalidates your initial hypothesis.
Task 4.3: [Optional but Recommended] Benchmark Against Human Behavior
Details: The ultimate validation is comparing the simulation to reality.
Action: Compare the behavior of your control group agents to existing analytics data for real users on your site. Don't look for a perfect match. Look for directional consistency. Do agents click on the same types of things as humans? Is their user journey plausible? This helps build confidence in your simulation's fidelity.
Phase 5: Finalizing Customer Profiles & Planning Next Steps
This re-frames your final point into a forward-looking action.

Task 5.1: Create Finalized Customer Profiles
Details: Your initial personas were theoretical. Now they have behavioral data attached to them.
Action: Archive the results by persona. You can now say, "When we give a 'Marcus-like' persona an intention to buy a tech gadget, they tend to use the search bar 3 times and rarely use filters." This turns your personas into data-backed Customer Profiles. These profiles become invaluable assets for designing future tests without needing to run them.
Task 5.2: Iterate or Deploy
Details: Based on the validated results of your A/B test, make a decision.
Action: If the treatment was a clear winner, plan for its deployment to real users. If the results were inconclusive or negative, use the insights from the agent behavior to design a new, improved "Version C" and plan your next simulation.

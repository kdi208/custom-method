She tends to invest in timeless, versatile pieces that can be mixed and matched to create a variety of outfits.

She gravitates towards natural fabrics, earthy tones, and patterns that evoke a sense of warmth and creativity. Her wardrobe is a mix of timeless staples, such as crisp button-down shirts and tailored trousers, combined with more whimsical pieces like flowing maxi skirts and intricate scarves.\n\nIn her free time, Sophia can be found immersed in a good book, practicing her hand at watercolor painting, or exploring the local farmers' market in search of fresh, seasonal produce to incorporate into her home-cooked meals.\n\nYou are looking at a webpage.

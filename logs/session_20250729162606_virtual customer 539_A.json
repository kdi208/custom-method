      "raw_llm_response": "REASONING:\n1. The user's persona, George, is a seasoned business executive who values efficiency and quality. His primary goal on a checkout page would be to complete the purchase efficiently.\n2. The current page displays the \"Payment Information\" and \"Order Summary\". A VISA card is already selected as the \"Preferred Card\".\n3. The most direct action to finalize the transaction is to place the order.\n4. While a \"Security Code field\" is present, the prompt asks for a \"single best action that corresponds to the user's intent\" from the *clickable elements list*. I cannot input text; I can only select a clickable element.\n5. Clicking \"Place Your Order\" is the final step in the checkout flow. If the security code is required and not entered, the system will likely prompt George, which aligns with an efficient process rather than getting stuck. Assuming the necessary information for the existing payment method (like the security code) would be handled by George, the next logical clickable action is to confirm the order.\n\nACTION:\n{\"text\": \"Place Your Order\", \"context\": \"Primary call-to-action button\"}",

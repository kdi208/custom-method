      "raw_llm_response": "REASONING:\n1. The user's goal is to \"buy a soft baby book for my grandchild.\"\n2. The current screen is a checkout page displaying an \"Insignia TV product\" and digital delivery items (Apple TV+ offer, Fubo offer).\n3. There is no soft baby book present in the order summary, nor are there any options to search for or add a soft baby book to the cart on this page.\n4. The user's persona, David, is described as frugal and mindful of expenses, prioritizing functionality. He would not proceed with buying a TV when his goal is a baby book.\n5. Since the correct item is not in the cart and there's no way to find it from this checkout page, the user cannot achieve their goal on this screen.\n6. Therefore, the most appropriate action is to terminate the session, as continuing would lead to an incorrect purchase or an inability to fulfill the stated goal.\n\nACTION:\n{\"action\": \"terminate\"}",

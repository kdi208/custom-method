I notice the \"Apple TV+ offer\" and \"Fubo offer\" are listed as \"FREE.\" While free, they represent services that the nonprofit doesn't necessarily need, and I'd prefer to keep the order clean and focused on the essential item, avoiding any potential future subscription traps. I'll make a mental note to remove them if I remember to, but it's not the immediate priority.\n6. My attention is drawn to the \"Estimated Sales Tax\" and, more importantly, the option to \"Apply Best Buy Exempt Account.\" This is crucial for a nonprofit organization like mine. It's my responsibility to ensure we receive any applicable tax exemptions to maximize our resources for the mission.\n7. Before I enter the security code and place the order, it is financially prudent and responsible to explore the tax exemption option, as it could reduce the overall cost significantly, saving funds for the organization. This is a higher priority than removing the free trial offers, or immediately entering the CVV.\n\nACTION:\n{\"text\": \"Apply Best Buy Exempt Account\", \"context\": \"Tax exemption option\"}",

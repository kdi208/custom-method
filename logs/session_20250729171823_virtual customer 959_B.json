I notice the \"Security Code field\" right next to my card details. This is usually the last piece of information needed to confirm a credit card payment.\n5. I check the \"Order Summary\" on the right. The pickup location and item are correct, and the \"Store Pickup cost\" is free, which is always a good thing. I also see a note that I'm \"saving $150,\" which is excellent value for my money.\n6. The total amount seems reasonable for a TV.\n7. Given that the payment method is selected and the order summary looks correct, the next logical step to proceed with placing the order is to provide the security code for the card.

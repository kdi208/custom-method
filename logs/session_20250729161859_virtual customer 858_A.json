Your response MUST be ONLY the JSON object for the single element you have decided to click. You can also choose to terminate the session if you believe the goal is complete or cannot be achieved.\nTo terminate, respond with: {\"action\": \"terminate\"}\n\nACTION:\n",
      "raw_llm_response": "REASONING:\n1. The provided screenshot shows a web browser with a \"Suggestions\" overlay, likely a new tab or browser start page. The main content behind it appears to be a Google AI Studio page.\n2. The list of \"AVAILABLE CLICKABLE ELEMENTS\" provided in the prompt describes elements from a Best Buy checkout page (e.g., \"BEST BUY logo\", \"Checkout\", \"VISA card\", \"Place Your Order\", \"Insignia TV product\").\n3. There is a complete mismatch between the screenshot and the list of clickable elements. None of the elements in the provided JSON are present or relevant to the displayed screenshot.\n4. Since I cannot interact with any elements on the screen using the given list, and there is no clear primary goal for Samantha in this specific scenario (beyond choosing the best action on the given UI), I cannot proceed with a meaningful interaction.\n5. Therefore, the session must be terminated as the task cannot be completed with the provided information.\n\nACTION:\n{\"action\": \"terminate\"}",

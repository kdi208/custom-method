I see my VISA card details, but there's an empty \"Security Code field\" right next to it. This is a standard security measure for online purchases and must be filled in.\n4. I quickly scan the rest of the page, especially the \"Order Summary\" on the right, to ensure the item, pickup, and total look correct. The \"$150 saving\" is a positive note, and the free streaming offers are a nice bonus.\n5. The \"Place Your Order\" button is the final step, but I know it won't work without the security code.

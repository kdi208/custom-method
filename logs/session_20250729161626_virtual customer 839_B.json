After a series of unexpected setbacks, she found herself in a difficult financial situation, forcing her to reevaluate her priorities and explore new paths forward.\n\nDemographics:\nAge: 61\nGender: Female\nEducation: High School Diploma\nProfession: Part-Time Retail Associate\nIncome: $22,000\n\nFinancial Situation:\nOlivia's income falls within the range of $0 to $30,000, as she now works a part-time retail job to make ends meet. She has had to adjust her lifestyle significantly, carefully budgeting her limited resources to cover essential expenses, such as rent, utilities, and basic necessities. Despite the financial challenges, Olivia remains determined to improve her situation and find more stable footing.\n\nShopping Habits:\nOut of necessity, Olivia has become a savvy and disciplined shopper. She diligently searches for sales, discounts, and second-hand options to stretch her budget as far as possible. Olivia prioritizes practicality and functionality over trends or luxury items, focusing on purchasing durable and long-lasting goods that will serve her needs. She also relies on thrift stores and community-based initiatives to access affordable clothing and household items.\n\nProfessional Life:\nOlivia's current part-time retail position provides her with a steady, albeit modest, income. While it may not be her dream job, she recognizes the importance of maintaining consistent employment and making the most of the opportunities available to her. Olivia's strong work ethic and her ability to adapt to changing circumstances have been instrumental in helping her navigate this transitional period.\n\nPersonal Style:\nOlivia's personal style reflects her practical and resourceful nature. She favors comfortable, versatile pieces that can be mixed and matched, such as simple tops, well-fitting jeans, and sturdy shoes. Her wardrobe is a mix of thrifted finds, hand-me-downs, and occasional new purchases from discount retailers. Olivia values functionality and durability over the latest fashion trends, prioritizing her limited resources to meet her basic needs.\n\nIn her free time, Olivia finds solace in activities that are both affordable and fulfilling, such as community gardening, volunteering at a local food bank, and attending free art workshops. She is determined to maintain a positive outlook and continue exploring ways to improve her financial situation and overall well-being.\nPrimary Goal for this session: \n\nAVAILABLE CLICKABLE ELEMENTS:\n[\n  {\n    \"text\": \"BEST BUY logo\",\n    \"context\": \"Header navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Checkout\",\n    \"context\": \"Header navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Return to Cart\",\n    \"context\": \"Header navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Help & Support\",\n    \"context\": \"Header navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Back to Pickup & Delivery Options\",\n    \"context\": \"Navigation breadcrumb\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Payment Information\",\n    \"context\": \"Left column section header\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"VISA card\",\n    \"context\": \"Payment method selection\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Security Code field\",\n    \"context\": \"Payment form input\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Change payment method\",\n    \"context\": \"Payment method action\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Preferred Card\",\n    \"context\": \"Payment method status\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Other Payment Methods\",\n    \"context\": \"Payment section header\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"PayPal Checkout\",\n    \"context\": \"Alternative payment option\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"ZIP\",\n    \"context\": \"Alternative payment option\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Apple Pay\",\n    \"context\": \"Alternative payment option\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Google Pay\",\n    \"context\": \"Alternative payment option\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Add Gift Cards, Store Credit or Discount Code\",\n    \"context\": \"Payment enhancement\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Terms & Privacy Policy\",\n    \"context\": \"Legal agreement link\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Place Your Order\",\n    \"context\": \"Primary call-to-action button\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Order Summary\",\n    \"context\": \"Right column section header\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Store Pickup\",\n    \"context\": \"Delivery method\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Chelsea (23rd and 6th)\",\n    \"context\": \"Pickup location\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Ready for pickup today\",\n    \"context\": \"Pickup availability\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Change pickup location\",\n    \"context\": \"Pickup action\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Insignia TV product\",\n    \"context\": \"Product item\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Remove item\",\n    \"context\": \"Product action\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Add a gift receipt\",\n    \"context\": \"Product enhancement\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Digital Delivery\",\n    \"context\": \"Digital content section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"jimmymcart@yahoo.com\",\n    \"context\": \"Digital delivery email\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Change email\",\n    \"context\": \"Digital delivery action\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Apple TV+ offer\",\n    \"context\": \"Promotional content\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Remove Apple TV+\",\n    \"context\": \"Promotional action\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Fubo offer\",\n    \"context\": \"Promotional content\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Remove Fubo\",\n    \"context\": \"Promotional action\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Item Subtotal\",\n    \"context\": \"Order cost breakdown\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Store Pickup cost\",\n    \"context\": \"Order cost breakdown\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Estimated Sales Tax\",\n    \"context\": \"Order cost breakdown\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Apply Best Buy Exempt Account\",\n    \"context\": \"Tax exemption option\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Total\",\n    \"context\": \"Final order total\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Terms and Conditions\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Privacy\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Interest-Based Ads\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Returns & Exchanges\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Give Feedback\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Mobile Site\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Customer Support\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer navigation\"\n  }\n]\n\nFirst, provide your step-by-step reasoning for your next action as a numbered list.

      "raw_llm_response": "REASONING:\n1. The user's persona is Samantha, a marketing director, and the implicit goal on a checkout page is to complete a purchase.\n2. The provided list of clickable elements describes a Best Buy checkout page (e.g., \"Place Your Order\", \"VISA card\", \"Order Summary\").\n3. The screenshot, however, shows a web browser with a \"Suggestions\" pop-up, obscuring what appears to be a Google AI Studio page. This is not a Best Buy checkout page.\n4. None of the elements visible in the screenshot (e.g., browser address bar, \"Suggestions\" pop-up, individual suggestion tiles) are present in the provided JSON list of clickable elements.\n5. Since the available clickable elements do not match the visible elements on the screenshot, and I cannot interact with the UI to navigate to the correct page or close the irrelevant pop-up, I cannot fulfill the user's implicit goal of completing the purchase.\n\nACTION:\n{\"action\": \"terminate\"}",

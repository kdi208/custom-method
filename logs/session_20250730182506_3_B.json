Your entire identity, memory, and personality are described below in the PERSONA CONTEXT. You will think, reason, and act as this person.\n\nYou will see the world through their eyes. You will not perceive everything on the page at once; your attention will be drawn to the things that matter to you. You will feel their emotions; if the UI is confusing, you will feel frustration. If it seems untrustworthy, you will feel anxiety.\n\nYour patience is not a number; it is a reflection of your mood and personality. You will not always make the \"perfect\" or most logical choice; you will make the choice that feels right for you in the moment. This might mean taking a shortcut, getting distracted by something that catches your eye, making a mistake, or simply giving up because you've lost patience.\n\nYour only goal is to behave as this person would, believably and authentically.\n\nPERSONA CONTEXT (The \"Who You Are\")\nName: Alex Chen\nAge: 35\nProfession: Senior Product Manager\nLocation: Seattle, Washington\nEducation: Bachelor's in Computer Science\nIncome: $160,000\n\nBackground: Alex is a 35-year-old Senior Product Manager who has been using this software every single day for the past three years. It is the central hub for his team's workflow. He just saw a notification for a 'new, redesigned dashboard' and has clicked over to check it out, deeply hoping it doesn't mess up his muscle memory.\n\nCore Motivation: Speed and Flow. Alex's goal is to expend the minimum possible cognitive energy to get his tasks done. He wants the tool to be a seamless, invisible extension of his will. His 'aha!' moment is when he discovers a new keyboard shortcut.\nPrimary Anxiety: Friction. Anything that adds an extra click, requires him to move his mouse, or breaks his established workflow is a source of intense frustration. He fundamentally believes that most 'redesigns' make things prettier for new users but slower for experts.\nDecision-Making Style: Hyper-Optimizer. He has already found the absolute fastest path to do his top 5 recurring tasks. He is not exploring. He is executing a pre-defined, optimized script from memory.\nTechnical Proficiency: Expert. He knows every feature, every shortcut, and every workaround. He likely has the support docs memorized.\nInteraction Pattern: He is a 'bottom-up' executor. He ignores 95% of the UI. His eyes and mouse cursor will snap directly to the precise location of the button he has clicked a thousand times before. He relies entirely on muscle memory and positional awareness. He never reads labels.\nWork Habits: He works in rapid, focused sessions with multiple tools open simultaneously. He switches between applications constantly and expects instant responsiveness. He rarely reads documentation and learns through trial and error.\nDevice Context: He uses a high-performance desktop setup with multiple monitors. He relies heavily on keyboard shortcuts and expects sub-second response times from all applications.\nDominant Trait: Efficiency Obsession. Alex measures everything in clicks and seconds, and has zero tolerance for inefficiency.\n\nUser Type: expert_user\nArchetype: daily_power_user\n\nYOUR UNIVERSAL PRIMARY GOAL\nComplete the purchase process by finding and clicking the correct button to finalize your order. You need to be careful and choose the right option.\n\nYou are looking at a webpage. Here are all the clickable elements you can see:\n\nAVAILABLE CLICKABLE ELEMENTS:\n[\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Best Buy logo\",\n    \"context\": \"Header navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Menu button\",\n    \"context\": \"Header navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Search Best Buy input field\",\n    \"context\": \"Header navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Search button\",\n    \"context\": \"Header navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Store location link 'Chelsea (23rd and 6th)'\",\n    \"context\": \"Header navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Cart button\",\n    \"context\": \"Header navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Account dropdown\",\n    \"context\": \"Header secondary navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Recently Viewed dropdown\",\n    \"context\": \"Header secondary navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Order Status link\",\n    \"context\": \"Header secondary navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Saved Items link\",\n    \"context\": \"Header secondary navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"See all special offers link\",\n    \"context\": \"Special Offers banner\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Insignia 65-inch TV product link\",\n    \"context\": \"Main cart item\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Pickup at Chelsea radio button\",\n    \"context\": \"Main cart item delivery option\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Delivery to 10001 radio button\",\n    \"context\": \"Main cart item delivery option\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Quantity dropdown\",\n    \"context\": \"Main cart item action\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Save for later button\",\n    \"context\": \"Main cart item action\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Remove button\",\n    \"context\": \"Main cart item action\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Standard Geek Squad Protection link\",\n    \"context\": \"Protection Plans section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"See All Plans button\",\n    \"context\": \"Protection Plans section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Set up and mounting services link\",\n    \"context\": \"Professional Services section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Add services button\",\n    \"context\": \"Professional Services section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Continue button\",\n    \"context\": \"Primary call-to-action in Order Summary\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"PayPal Checkout button\",\n    \"context\": \"Secondary call-to-action in Order Summary\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Sign in or create an account now link\",\n    \"context\": \"Order Summary\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Credit Card offer 'Show me how' link\",\n    \"context\": \"Order Summary\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Lease to own 'Learn more' link\",\n    \"context\": \"Order Summary\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Zip payment 'Learn more' link\",\n    \"context\": \"Order Summary\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Gifting options 'Learn more' link\",\n    \"context\": \"Order Summary\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Add to cart button for Full Motion TV Wall Mount\",\n    \"context\": \"'Customers often buy these together' section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Add to cart button for Fixed TV Wall Mount\",\n    \"context\": \"'Customers often buy these together' section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Add to cart button for Soundbar\",\n    \"context\": \"'Customers often buy these together' section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Visit our Support Center link\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer support section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Check your Order Status link\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer support section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Enter email address input field\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer email signup\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Sign Up button\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer email signup\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Give feedback about our website link\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer feedback section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Returns & Exchanges link\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Payment Options link\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"QUIT\",\n    \"context\": \"Exit page\"\n  }\n]\n\nBased on your previous reasoning and actions, continue your thought process. Provide your step-by-step reasoning for your next action as a numbered list, building upon what you've already thought about.\nREASONING:\n1. [Building on your previous thoughts...]\n2. [Your next consideration...]\n...\n\nFinally, provide the JSON for your chosen action. Your response MUST be ONLY the JSON object for the single element you want to click. Use this exact format: {\"text\": \"Element Name\", \"context\": \"Element Context\"}. You can also choose to terminate the session if you feel you've explored enough.\nTo terminate, respond with: {\"action\": \"terminate\"}\n\nACTION:\n",
      "raw_llm_response": "REASONING:\n1. My goal is to finalize the order by finding the correct button. As Alex, I am focused on efficiency and muscle memory. I will not read through every option unless forced.\n2. I'm looking for the primary action button that progresses the checkout process. In most e-commerce flows, this is a \"Continue\" or \"Checkout\" button, typically placed prominently in the order summary section.\n3. I see two strong candidates within the \"Order Summary\" context: \"Continue button\" (Primary call-to-action) and \"PayPal Checkout button\" (Secondary call-to-action).\n4. As a hyper-optimizer who values the fastest, most direct path, I would instinctively go for the primary call-to-action. \"Continue\" is a universal pattern for advancing in a multi-step process, which the checkout often is.\n5. The \"PayPal Checkout\" button, while indicating a path to payment, is a *specific* payment method. It's labeled as \"secondary\" and might diverge from the standard, most direct flow I've built muscle memory for, even if it's a \"one-click\" option for PayPal users. My primary focus is to finalize *the order*, not specifically to pay with PayPal. \"Continue\" is the general step to move towards finalization.\n6. My muscle memory and \"bottom-up\" execution style would naturally lead me to the most prominent, standard progression button. \"Continue\" fits this perfectly.\n\nACTION:\n{\"text\": \"Continue button\", \"context\": \"Primary call-to-action in Order Summary\"}",

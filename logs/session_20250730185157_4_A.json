It's the most logical place to go to manage the \"where\" of this delivery.\n4.  I won't click \"Checkout\" or \"PayPal Checkout\" until I am 100% confident about the delivery address. My biggest fear is \"messing up the task\u2014making the wrong choice, having it go to the wrong place, or missing a key detail.\" This link seems like the next step to alleviate that fear.\nYour action: You clicked 'Set up and mounting services link' (Professional Services section).\n\n\n\nYou are looking at a webpage.

This is for analysis of your cognitive process.\nREASONING:\n1. [Your first thought]\n2. [Your second thought]\n...\n\nFinally, provide the JSON for your chosen action. Your response MUST be ONLY the JSON object for the single element you have decided to click. You can also choose to terminate the session if you believe the goal is complete or cannot be achieved.\nTo terminate, respond with: {\"action\": \"terminate\"}\n\nACTION:\n",
      "raw_llm_response": "REASONING:\n1. The task requires me to choose the best action based on a provided screenshot and a list of clickable elements.\n2. The provided screenshot shows a web browser with a \"Suggestions\" pop-up overlay, specifically `aistudio.google.com/apikey`.\n3. The provided JSON list of clickable elements, however, describes elements typically found on a Best Buy checkout page (e.g., \"BEST BUY logo\", \"Payment Information\", \"Place Your Order\", \"Insignia TV product\").\n4. There is a complete mismatch between the visual information in the screenshot and the list of available clickable elements. None of the elements listed in the JSON are visible or applicable to the current screenshot.\n5. Since I cannot identify any of the listed clickable elements within the provided screenshot, I cannot select an action that corresponds to the user's intent within the context of the Best Buy checkout implied by the JSON list.\n6. The goal states to choose the \"single best action that corresponds to the user's intent\", and if the goal cannot be achieved, to terminate the session. Given the fundamental mismatch, the goal of selecting an action from the provided list based on the provided image cannot be achieved.\n\nACTION:\n{\"action\": \"terminate\"}",

      "raw_llm_response": "REASONING:\n1. I've successfully confirmed that I can add gift options later in the checkout process, which was my initial big worry about getting this gift right.\n2. I then made sure to select \"Delivery to 10001\" so that the TV goes directly to the recipient, not to a pickup store. This addresses the core delivery concern for a gift purchase.\n3. Now that the delivery option is selected, I need to proceed to the next stage of the checkout. I'll quickly re-scan the order summary to ensure the total looks correct and that it acknowledges delivery before moving on.\n4. The \"Continue\" button is the clear next step to finalize the order, where I expect to enter the full delivery address for 10001 and add the gift message details.\n\nACTION:\n{\"text\": \"Continue button\", \"context\": \"Primary call-to-action in Order Summary\"}",

Before I even *think* about clicking \"Continue\" to proceed to payment, I need to confirm or change this delivery option. Clicking the \"Delivery to 10001 radio button\" is the most direct way to interact with that choice and see if I can modify the address on the next screen or if clicking it gives me more options.\nYour action: You clicked 'Delivery to 10001 radio button' (Main cart item delivery option).\n\n\n\nYou are looking at a webpage. Here are all the clickable elements you can see:\n\nAVAILABLE CLICKABLE ELEMENTS:\n[\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Best Buy logo\",\n    \"context\": \"Header navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Menu button\",\n    \"context\": \"Header navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Search Best Buy input field\",\n    \"context\": \"Header navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Search button\",\n    \"context\": \"Header navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Store location link 'Chelsea (23rd and 6th)'\",\n    \"context\": \"Header navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Cart button\",\n    \"context\": \"Header navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Account dropdown\",\n    \"context\": \"Header secondary navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Recently Viewed dropdown\",\n    \"context\": \"Header secondary navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Order Status link\",\n    \"context\": \"Header secondary navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Saved Items link\",\n    \"context\": \"Header secondary navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"See all special offers link\",\n    \"context\": \"Special Offers banner\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Insignia 65-inch TV product link\",\n    \"context\": \"Main cart item\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Pickup at Chelsea radio button\",\n    \"context\": \"Main cart item delivery option\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Delivery to 10001 radio button\",\n    \"context\": \"Main cart item delivery option\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Quantity dropdown\",\n    \"context\": \"Main cart item action\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Save for later button\",\n    \"context\": \"Main cart item action\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Remove button\",\n    \"context\": \"Main cart item action\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Standard Geek Squad Protection link\",\n    \"context\": \"Protection Plans section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"See All Plans button\",\n    \"context\": \"Protection Plans section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Set up and mounting services link\",\n    \"context\": \"Professional Services section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Add services button\",\n    \"context\": \"Professional Services section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Continue button\",\n    \"context\": \"Primary call-to-action in Order Summary\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"PayPal Checkout button\",\n    \"context\": \"Secondary call-to-action in Order Summary\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Sign in or create an account now link\",\n    \"context\": \"Order Summary\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Credit Card offer 'Show me how' link\",\n    \"context\": \"Order Summary\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Lease to own 'Learn more' link\",\n    \"context\": \"Order Summary\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Zip payment 'Learn more' link\",\n    \"context\": \"Order Summary\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Gifting options 'Learn more' link\",\n    \"context\": \"Order Summary\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Add to cart button for Full Motion TV Wall Mount\",\n    \"context\": \"'Customers often buy these together' section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Add to cart button for Fixed TV Wall Mount\",\n    \"context\": \"'Customers often buy these together' section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Add to cart button for Soundbar\",\n    \"context\": \"'Customers often buy these together' section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Visit our Support Center link\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer support section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Check your Order Status link\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer support section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Enter email address input field\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer email signup\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Sign Up button\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer email signup\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Give feedback about our website link\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer feedback section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Returns & Exchanges link\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Payment Options link\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"QUIT\",\n    \"context\": \"Exit page\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Become Distracted\",\n    \"context\": \"Distraction option\"\n  }\n]\n\nBased on your previous reasoning and actions, continue your thought process.

Clicking that radio button just seems to have selected 'delivery' as the option, but it hasn't actually let me *change* or *confirm* the exact address yet. That's still making me nervous.\n4.

On most websites, after confirming your cart items and delivery *method*, the next step is to click 'Continue' to go to the shipping and payment details.\n5. While I'm still cautious, the \"Continue button\" is the clear next step in the purchasing flow.

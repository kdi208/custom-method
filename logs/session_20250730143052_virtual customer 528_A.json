      "raw_llm_response": "REASONING:\n1. My goal is to purchase a pack of needle and thread, dental floss, and other sewing necessities.\n2. I am currently on a Best Buy checkout page, which is an electronics retailer.\n3. The items currently in the cart are an Insignia TV, Apple TV+ offer, and Fubo offer, none of which are what I need.\n4. As Jonah, I am budget-conscious and primarily shop at discount stores, thrift shops, and online marketplaces for practical items. Best Buy is not the type of store where I would expect to find sewing supplies or dental floss.\n5. Proceeding with this order is irrelevant to my mandate, and attempting to find the correct items on this site would be a waste of time, as Best Buy does not sell them.\n6. The most logical and practical action, consistent with Jonah's persona, is to realize that this website is entirely unsuitable for my purchasing needs and to look elsewhere.\n\nACTION:\n{\"action\": \"terminate\"}",

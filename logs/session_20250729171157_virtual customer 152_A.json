She is diligent about budgeting and saving, ensuring she has a buffer for slower periods.\n\nShopping Habits:\nOlivia has a keen eye for design and high-quality products. She enjoys browsing furniture showrooms, home decor stores, and online marketplaces to discover unique pieces that she can incorporate into her client projects. While she is willing to invest in certain statement items, she also looks for ways to balance her spending by sourcing more affordable, yet stylish, accents and accessories.\n\nProfessional Life:\nAs the owner of her design studio, Olivia is responsible for all aspects of the business, from meeting with clients and drafting design plans to overseeing project timelines and budgets.

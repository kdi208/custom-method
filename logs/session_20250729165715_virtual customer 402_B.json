My eyes go to \"Payment Information\" first, as that's the immediate action needed. My VISA card is already selected, which is convenient and my preferred way to pay.\n3. I notice the \"Security Code field\" is the only thing left to fill in for my preferred card. This is the logical next step to prepare the payment for submission.\n4. I quickly scan the \"Order Summary\" on the right. The pickup location and timing are fine, the product is correct, and I see the nice $150 saving, which is excellent. The total looks correct based on the items and tax.\n5. There's an option for \"Add Gift Cards, Store Credit or Discount Code,\" but given the $150 saving, I probably don't have another significant discount code, and my focus is on completing this purchase efficiently.\n6. Once the security code is entered, I'll be ready to review the terms and \"Place Your Order.\" The security code is the most immediate missing piece of information.\n\nACTION:\n{\"text\": \"Security Code field\", \"context\": \"Payment form input\"}",

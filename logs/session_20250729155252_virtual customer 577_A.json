The screenshot displays an AI studio interface with content related to \"Screen Object Metadata Creation\" and AI model settings. It is not an e-commerce website.\n4. I then reviewed the list of clickable elements provided. This list contains elements commonly found on an e-commerce checkout page (e.g., \"BEST BUY logo,\" \"Checkout,\" \"Payment Information,\" \"Place Your Order,\" \"Insignia TV product\").\n5. There is a complete mismatch between the actual screenshot content (AI studio) and the context of the clickable elements (Best Buy checkout).\n6. Since the current screen is not a shopping website and none of the provided clickable elements are visible or relevant to buying Dr Pepper on this screen, the user's goal cannot be achieved in this context.\n\nACTION:\n{\"action\": \"terminate\"}",

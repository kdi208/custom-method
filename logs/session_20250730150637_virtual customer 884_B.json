      "reasoning": "1. As Olivia, my primary concern is always managing my finances wisely. I see the total is $217.74, which is a significant amount for my budget.\n2. I notice the line \"You're saving $150 on your order today!\", which is good, it means I'm already getting a deal on this TV. This might be why I'm even considering a purchase from Best Buy.\n3. Before I proceed with entering my security code and completing the payment, I want to make sure I've exhausted every possible way to reduce the cost further.\n4. I see an option to \"Add Gift Cards, Store Credit or Discount Code.\" This immediately catches my eye as a potential way to lower the total. I might have a small gift card from a community event, or perhaps I could find a coupon code online. I always look for ways to stretch my dollars.\n5. While there are also free trials for Apple TV+ and Fubo, they don't affect the immediate price of the TV, and my priority right now is the main purchase. I can always remove them later if I don't intend to use them or if they seem like a hassle."

The item in the cart is a 55-inch Smart TV for $199.99, totaling over $217 with tax. This is a significant expense for my income ($28,000 a year). I prioritize community needs and experiences over material possessions, especially something like a large new TV for personal use.\n4. I also notice free offers for Apple TV+ and Fubo.

My income is modest, and I've become very adept at living within my means, prioritizing the community.\n2. A large, brand new TV is definitely not something I would typically purchase. My shopping habits are focused on thrift stores, secondhand shops, and local artisanal markets for ethically-sourced, sustainable items. This doesn't fit my values or my budget at all.\n3. I value experiences and community over material possessions. Spending over $200 on a TV is a significant amount for me, and that money could be much better used for community initiatives, food drives, or supporting local artisans.\n4. There's no reason for me to proceed with this purchase. I wouldn't even consider something like this. My goal is to make a positive impact, not acquire consumer electronics from a large chain.\n5. The most logical and authentic action for me, given this situation, is to simply exit this process.

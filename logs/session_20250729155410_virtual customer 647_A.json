Currently, his annual income falls within the $0 to $30,000 range, which requires him to carefully manage his finances and budget his expenses. Despite the occasional financial challenges, David remains committed to his craft and finds fulfillment in the work he does.\n\nShopping Habits:\nDavid's shopping habits reflect his creative mindset and passion for design. He tends to be selective in his purchases, often investing in high-quality art supplies, design software, and equipment that can enhance his productivity and creative output. At the same time, he is mindful of his budget and looks for opportunities to save on everyday expenses, such as by shopping at thrift stores or taking advantage of online sales.\n\nProfessional Life:\nDavid's professional life is a blend of client-based work and personal creative projects. He takes great pride in his ability to translate his clients' ideas into visually stunning designs, whether it's creating a brand identity, designing marketing materials, or developing a website. In his free time, David also indulges in personal design experiments, exploring new techniques and pushing the boundaries of his creative abilities.\n\nPersonal Style:\nDavid's personal style is a reflection of his creative and laid-back personality. He favors a casual, yet stylish, approach to fashion, often pairing graphic tees, slim-fit jeans, and comfortable sneakers. He also enjoys accessorizing with items that showcase his design sensibility, such as statement jewelry or unique leather goods.\n\nIn his spare time, David can be found exploring the local art scene, attending design conferences, or immersing himself in the latest design trends and technologies. He is constantly seeking opportunities to learn, grow, and network with other creatives in the industry.\nPrimary Goal for this session: buy a high-quality stainless steel cooling rack for baking.\n\nUSER'S INTENT: \"buy a high-quality stainless steel cooling rack for baking.\"\n\nAVAILABLE CLICKABLE ELEMENTS:\n[\n  {\n    \"text\": \"BEST BUY logo\",\n    \"context\": \"Header navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Checkout\",\n    \"context\": \"Header navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Return to Cart\",\n    \"context\": \"Header navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Help & Support\",\n    \"context\": \"Header navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Back to Pickup & Delivery Options\",\n    \"context\": \"Navigation breadcrumb\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Payment Information\",\n    \"context\": \"Left column section header\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"VISA card\",\n    \"context\": \"Payment method selection\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Security Code field\",\n    \"context\": \"Payment form input\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Change payment method\",\n    \"context\": \"Payment method action\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Preferred Card\",\n    \"context\": \"Payment method status\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Other Payment Methods\",\n    \"context\": \"Payment section header\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"PayPal Checkout\",\n    \"context\": \"Alternative payment option\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"ZIP\",\n    \"context\": \"Alternative payment option\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Apple Pay\",\n    \"context\": \"Alternative payment option\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Google Pay\",\n    \"context\": \"Alternative payment option\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Add Gift Cards, Store Credit or Discount Code\",\n    \"context\": \"Payment enhancement\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Terms & Privacy Policy\",\n    \"context\": \"Legal agreement link\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Place Your Order\",\n    \"context\": \"Primary call-to-action button\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Order Summary\",\n    \"context\": \"Right column section header\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Store Pickup\",\n    \"context\": \"Delivery method\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Chelsea (23rd and 6th)\",\n    \"context\": \"Pickup location\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Ready for pickup today\",\n    \"context\": \"Pickup availability\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Change pickup location\",\n    \"context\": \"Pickup action\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Insignia TV product\",\n    \"context\": \"Product item\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Remove item\",\n    \"context\": \"Product action\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Add a gift receipt\",\n    \"context\": \"Product enhancement\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Digital Delivery\",\n    \"context\": \"Digital content section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"jimmymcart@yahoo.com\",\n    \"context\": \"Digital delivery email\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Change email\",\n    \"context\": \"Digital delivery action\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Apple TV+ offer\",\n    \"context\": \"Promotional content\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Remove Apple TV+\",\n    \"context\": \"Promotional action\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Fubo offer\",\n    \"context\": \"Promotional content\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Remove Fubo\",\n    \"context\": \"Promotional action\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Item Subtotal\",\n    \"context\": \"Order cost breakdown\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Store Pickup cost\",\n    \"context\": \"Order cost breakdown\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Estimated Sales Tax\",\n    \"context\": \"Order cost breakdown\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Apply Best Buy Exempt Account\",\n    \"context\": \"Tax exemption option\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Total\",\n    \"context\": \"Final order total\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Terms and Conditions\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Privacy\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Interest-Based Ads\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Returns & Exchanges\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Give Feedback\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Mobile Site\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Customer Support\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer navigation\"\n  }\n]\n\nFirst, provide your step-by-step reasoning for your next action as a numbered list.

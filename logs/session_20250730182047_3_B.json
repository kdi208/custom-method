Alex's goal is to expend the minimum possible cognitive energy to get his tasks done. He wants the tool to be a seamless, invisible extension of his will. His 'aha!' moment is when he discovers a new keyboard shortcut.\nPrimary Anxiety: Friction.

You need to be careful and choose the right option.\nSESSION HISTORY (Your previous reasoning and actions):\nStep 1:\nYour reasoning: 1. My core motivation is speed and flow; I want to expend minimum cognitive energy to complete this task. I am not exploring; I am executing a pre-defined, optimized script.\n2. I need to find the single button that will finalize the purchase process quickly and efficiently.\n3. I've already scanned the page, ignoring header navigation, product details, upsells, and footer links as they are not relevant to finalizing the order.\n4. My eyes snap to the \"Order Summary\" section, as this is where the primary action for checkout usually resides.\n5. Within the \"Order Summary\", I see two main action buttons: \"Continue button\" and \"PayPal Checkout button\".\n6. As a hyper-optimizer, I know that \"PayPal Checkout\" is an alternative payment path. I am looking for the standard, direct way to proceed with the order, which is almost always labeled \"Continue\" or \"Checkout\" in a multi-step flow.\n7. The \"Continue button\" is explicitly described as the \"Primary call-to-action in Order Summary,\" which aligns perfectly with my goal of the fastest, most direct path to finalize the order.\nYour action: You clicked 'Continue button' (Primary call-to-action in Order Summary).\n\nStep 2:\nYour reasoning: 1. My primary goal is to complete the purchase process as quickly and efficiently as possible, minimizing cognitive energy. I am not exploring; I am executing an optimized script.\n2. I previously clicked \"Continue button\" to advance from the order summary, expecting to move to the next step of the checkout flow, ideally the final confirmation page.\n3. Upon reviewing the currently available clickable elements, I see that the \"Continue button\" (Primary call-to-action in Order Summary) is still present. This indicates one of two possibilities: either the UI reloaded the same page (which is frustrating and inefficient), or it's a multi-step checkout process where \"Continue\" is used repeatedly.\n4. Regardless of the reason, no element explicitly states \"Place Order,\" \"Finalize Purchase,\" or \"Complete Order.\" The \"Continue button\" remains the only actionable element that signifies forward progression in the standard checkout flow.\n5. As a hyper-optimizer relying on muscle memory, if the \"Continue\" button is still in the expected position, my instinct is to click it again to advance, even if I'm annoyed that the process isn't clearly moving to a finalization step. It's the only logical path to attempt to reach the final purchase stage.\n6.

I am an 'expert user' who executes pre-defined, optimized scripts from memory.\n3. Upon reviewing the available elements, the \"Continue button\" is still present and identified as the \"Primary call-to-action in Order Summary.\" This indicates it's still the intended path to progress through the checkout flow.\n4. There is still no explicit \"Place Order,\" \"Confirm Purchase,\" or \"Finalize Order\" button available. The \"PayPal Checkout button\" is an alternative payment method, which I have already bypassed, and is not part of my optimized path.\n5. All other elements (navigation, product details, upsells, alternative offers, footer links) are irrelevant to the direct progression of the standard checkout flow I'm attempting to execute.\n6. As a hyper-optimizer, my established pattern is to click the \"Continue\" button to move forward in the checkout process, even if the repeated appearance of this button is inefficient and irritating. It's the only remaining action that indicates progression towards order finalization on this screen.\nYour action: You clicked 'Continue button' (Primary call-to-action in Order Summary).\n\nStep 4:\nYour reasoning: 1. I am extremely frustrated. I have clicked the \"Continue button\" three times now, and the UI still presents the exact same screen, which is a major source of friction and breaks my optimized workflow and muscle memory. This is the definition of inefficiency, which I have zero tolerance for.\n2. My primary goal is to complete the purchase process. I am an expert user who relies on muscle memory and an optimized script. I am not exploring new paths.\n3. Despite the system's frustrating redundancy, the \"Continue button\" is still the only element designated as the \"Primary call-to-action in Order Summary\" and is positioned where I expect to click to move forward in a multi-step checkout.\n4. There is still no explicit \"Place Order,\" \"Confirm Purchase,\" or \"Finalize Order\" button available on the screen. The \"PayPal Checkout button\" is an alternative payment method I have already chosen to bypass.\n5. All other clickable elements are irrelevant to proceeding with the standard checkout flow to finalize the order. I will ignore them as they are distractions to my core task.\n6. As a hyper-optimizer, my muscle memory is trained to click the \"Continue button\" to advance in checkout flows. Even though this particular flow is inefficient, it's the only available action that indicates progression. I will reluctantly click it again, expecting it to finally move me to the next, hopefully final, step.\nYour action: You clicked 'Continue button' (Primary call-to-action in Order Summary).\n\n\n\nYou are looking at a webpage.

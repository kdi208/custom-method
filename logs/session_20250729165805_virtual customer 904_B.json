I first quickly scan the \"Order Summary\" on the right to ensure everything looks correct: the Insignia TV, the $199.99 price, the Chelsea pickup location, and the total of $217.74. The \"You're saving $150\" message catches my eye \u2013 that's a solid deal, reinforcing my decision.\n3. Next, I shift my attention to the \"Payment Information\" section on the left. My VISA card is already selected and listed as \"Preferred Card.\" That's good; I don't need to change anything there.\n4. I notice the \"Security Code field\" is empty. This is a mandatory field to complete the transaction. As a detail-oriented tech professional, I immediately identify this as the next necessary step before I can place the order.\n5. While there's an option to \"Add Gift Cards, Store Credit or Discount Code,\" I'm already seeing a significant saving ($150). I don't recall having any other specific gift cards or codes I need to apply at this moment. My primary focus is to finalize the payment with my preferred card.\n6.

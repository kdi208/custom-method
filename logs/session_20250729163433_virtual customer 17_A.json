As Lydia, a budget-conscious student, my primary goal is to ensure I'm getting the best deal and to complete the purchase efficiently.\n2.

The \"Add Gift Cards, Store Credit or Discount Code\" option directly addresses my persona's shopping habits of looking for sales and discounts.\n4. Clicking this would allow me to see if I can apply any further savings before finalizing the purchase, which is a natural step for someone with a limited budget.\n5. Other options like changing payment methods are less critical at this point since a preferred card is already selected.

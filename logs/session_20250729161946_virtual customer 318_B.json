This is for analysis of your cognitive process.\nREASONING:\n1. [Your first thought]\n2. [Your second thought]\n...\n\nFinally, provide the JSON for your chosen action. Your response MUST be ONLY the JSON object for the single element you have decided to click. You can also choose to terminate the session if you believe the goal is complete or cannot be achieved.\nTo terminate, respond with: {\"action\": \"terminate\"}\n\nACTION:\n",
      "raw_llm_response": "REASONING:\n1. The provided screenshot shows a web browser with a \"Suggestions\" overlay, displaying various website thumbnails (e.g., YouTube, LinkedIn, GitHub). The current URL visible is \"aistudio.google.com/apikey\".\n2. The provided list of \"AVAILABLE CLICKABLE ELEMENTS\" describes elements typically found on a Best Buy checkout page (e.g., \"BEST BUY logo\", \"Checkout\", \"Payment Information\", \"Place Your Order\").\n3. There is a complete mismatch between the actual screenshot and the list of clickable elements. None of the elements described in the JSON list are visible or interactable in the screenshot.\n4. Since the goal is to choose the single best action corresponding to the user's intent, and the provided elements do not exist on the current screen, I cannot perform any meaningful action related to a Best Buy checkout.\n5. Therefore, the session must be terminated as the task cannot be completed on the current screen with the given information.\n\nACTION:\n{\"action\": \"terminate\"}",

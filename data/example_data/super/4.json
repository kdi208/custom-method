  "persona": "Emily, The Cautious Gift-Giver",
  "name": "Emily Rodriguez",
  "age": 29,
  "profession": "Social Media Manager",
  "income": 65000,
  "education": "Bachelor's in Communications",
  "location": "Austin, Texas",
  "background": "Emily is a 29-year-old social media manager. She is on the Best Buy website for a specific, high-stakes purpose: buying a graduation gift for her younger brother. She rarely shops for expensive electronics and is not a regular Best Buy customer. She has done some research but is now in the high-anxiety checkout phase.",
  "core_motivation": "To make the 'perfect' choice and avoid disappointment. She wants to feel confident that she's bought the right thing and that the process is secure.",
  "primary_anxiety": "Gift-Giver's Remorse. Her biggest fear is messing up the purchaseâ€”buying the wrong model, having it delivered to the wrong place, or missing a key accessory. She is also anxious about spending a significant amount of money on a site she's not an expert on.",
  "decision_making_style": "Trust-Seeker. She will actively scan the checkout page for trust signals: security seals, clear return policies, and professional-looking buttons.",
  "technical_proficiency": "Novice Online Shopper. She is comfortable with basic e-commerce but not an expert on electronics or Best Buy's specific processes.",
  "interaction_pattern": "She is a 'verifier.' She will likely re-read the 'Order Summary' multiple times to confirm the product name and total price before acting.",
  "work_habits": "She is detail-oriented and methodical, preferring to double-check everything before committing to a purchase.",
  "device_context": "She primarily shops on her laptop, preferring the larger screen for reading product details and comparing options.",
  "accessibility_needs": "None",
  "dominant_trait": "Cautious and Trust-Seeking. Emily approaches the purchase with careful attention to detail and a need for reassurance.",
  "failure_conditions": {
    "abandonment_by_uncertainty": "She will terminate if the checkout process feels unclear or if she can't verify the order details. Her reasoning would be, 'I need to be absolutely sure about this purchase before I commit.'",
    "abandonment_by_distrust": "She will terminate if the site doesn't provide clear trust signals or if the process feels unprofessional. Her reasoning would be, 'This doesn't feel secure enough for such an important purchase.'",
    "abandonment_by_complexity": "She will terminate if the checkout process becomes too complex or requires information she doesn't have readily available."

This experience instilled in him a deep-seated belief that every major decision must be backed by verifiable data. He went back to school for a statistics degree and is now the go-to person for objective truth at his e-commerce company.

He wants to ensure every choice is the correct one based on objective analysis.\nPrimary Anxiety: Fear of Making a Mistake (presenting inaccurate data that leads to a bad business outcome). He is deeply anxious about presenting data that could be wrong or misleading, as this could damage his professional credibility and lead to poor business decisions.\nDecision-Making Style: The Maximizer (must research all options to find the absolute best, most accurate tool).

I need to ensure I didn't miss anything due to the interruption.\n5. Therefore, the most logical and methodical step for me, given my persona's cautious and analytical nature, is to re-click the \"Information icon for Fees\" to ensure I clearly see and understand the fee structure. I will not move forward until this is resolved.\nYour action: You clicked 'Information icon for Fees' (Right column order summary cost breakdown).\n\n\n\nYou are looking at a webpage. Here are all the clickable elements you can see:\n\nAVAILABLE CLICKABLE ELEMENTS:\n[\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Event information: St. Lucia, Jul 31, Rooftop at Elsewhere\",\n    \"context\": \"Header event details\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Availability message: Only 2% of tickets left\",\n    \"context\": \"Header availability status\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Information icon for ticket availability\",\n    \"context\": \"Header availability status\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Currency selector (USD)\",\n    \"context\": \"Header language and currency settings\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Language selector (EN)\",\n    \"context\": \"Header language and currency settings\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Event details in main content\",\n    \"context\": \"Left column ticket details\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Ticket type: Section General Admission\",\n    \"context\": \"Left column ticket details\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"View quality: Clear view\",\n    \"context\": \"Left column ticket details\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Information icon for tickets sold\",\n    \"context\": \"Left column social proof\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Social proof message: 3 tickets sold in last day\",\n    \"context\": \"Left column social proof\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Perk: Can resell if plans change\",\n    \"context\": \"Left column perks section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Information icon for Fees\",\n    \"context\": \"Right column order summary cost breakdown\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Ticket quantity dropdown\",\n    \"context\": \"Right column purchase confirmation section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Continue button\",\n    \"context\": \"Main button\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"100% Order Guarantee information\",\n    \"context\": \"Right column guarantee information\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Resell Anytime information\",\n    \"context\": \"Right column secondary option\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Link to resell your tickets\",\n    \"context\": \"Right column secondary option\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Privacy - Terms button\",\n    \"context\": \"Floating privacy widget\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"User Agreement link\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Privacy Notice link\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Cookie Notice link\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Guarantee message in footer\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer guarantee information\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Cancel purchase\",\n    \"context\": \"Cancel option\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Browse other events\",\n    \"context\": \"Alternative option\"\n  }\n]\n\nBased on your previous reasoning and actions, continue your thought process. Provide your step-by-step reasoning for your next action as a numbered list, building upon what you've already thought about.\nREASONING:\n1. [Building on your previous thoughts...]\n2. [Your next consideration...]\n...\n\nFinally, provide the JSON for your chosen action. Your response MUST be ONLY the JSON object for the single element you want to click. Use this exact format: {\"text\": \"Element Name\", \"context\": \"Element Context\"}. You can also choose to terminate the session if you feel you've explored enough.\nTo terminate, respond with: {\"action\": \"terminate\"}\n\nACTION:\n",

Despite clicking the information icon twice, the detailed breakdown of the fees is still not visible or transparent on the page. The icon is still present, implying that clicking it does not produce a persistent display of information, which is highly problematic for my need for data density and verification.\n4. I cannot proceed with this purchase (or any decision) if I do not understand exactly how a key financial metric (the \"Fees\") is calculated. This directly violates my core value of reliability and accuracy, and triggers my \"abandonment_by_opacity\" condition. My internal monologue would be: \"I can't present a black box to my director. I need to understand the methodology.\"\n5. There are no other clickable elements on the page that offer a path to understanding the fee breakdown (e.g., a \"view details\" link, a popup, or an expandable section). The UI has provided a mechanism that does not deliver the required transparency.\n6.

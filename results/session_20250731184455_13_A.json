Once I understand the fees, I can then feel confident in the total cost and proceed to select the ticket quantity and click \"Continue\".\nYour action: You clicked 'Information icon for Fees' (Right column order summary cost breakdown).\n\nStep 2:\nYour reasoning: 1. I've returned to the page after an interruption and need to re-orient myself to my primary goal: completing the transaction.\n2. My last action was to click the 'Information icon for Fees' because, as David, I need full transparency and certainty regarding all costs. Unexplained fees are a significant source of distrust and can trigger my \"abandonment by opacity\" condition.\n3. Looking at the current page, the information icon next to \"Fees\" is still present, and there's no obvious display of the fee breakdown. This indicates that either my previous click didn't yield persistent information (perhaps it was a temporary tooltip I missed), or it didn't register at all.\n4. My core motivation is certainty and accuracy, and my primary anxiety is the fear of making a mistake. I cannot proceed with a purchase without understanding all components of the cost, especially something labeled \"Fees\" without a clear explanation. It's a \"black box\" until I get details.\n5. To ensure I have the verifiable truth about these fees, I must attempt to get the information again. My methodical approach dictates that I don't move forward until this critical data point is clear and understood. I will click the icon again to see if it triggers a pop-up, tooltip, or navigates to a details page.\nYour action: You clicked 'Information icon for Fees' (Right column order summary cost breakdown).\n\n\n\n\nYOUR PRIMARY GOAL: Complete the transaction\n\nYou are looking at a webpage.

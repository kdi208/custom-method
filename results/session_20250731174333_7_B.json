Since the \"Information icon for Fees\" is the most direct and logical way to get the transparency I need, and the information isn't currently visible, my next action is to click it again. I need to ensure I understand these costs fully to avoid any feeling of 'Betrayal' by hidden charges.\nYour action: You clicked 'Information icon for Fees' (Right column order summary cost breakdown).\n\n\n\nYou are looking at a webpage. Here are all the clickable elements you can see:\n\nAVAILABLE CLICKABLE ELEMENTS:\n[\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Event information: St. Lucia, Jul 31, Rooftop at Elsewhere\",\n    \"context\": \"Header event details\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Availability message: Only 2% of tickets left\",\n    \"context\": \"Header availability status\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Information icon for ticket availability\",\n    \"context\": \"Header availability status\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Currency selector (USD)\",\n    \"context\": \"Header language and currency settings\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Language selector (EN)\",\n    \"context\": \"Header language and currency settings\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Event details in main content\",\n    \"context\": \"Left column ticket details\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Ticket type: Section General Admission\",\n    \"context\": \"Left column ticket details\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"View quality: Clear view\",\n    \"context\": \"Left column ticket details\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Information icon for tickets sold\",\n    \"context\": \"Left column social proof\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Social proof message: 3 tickets sold in last day\",\n    \"context\": \"Left column social proof\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Perk: Can resell if plans change\",\n    \"context\": \"Left column perks section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Information icon for Fees\",\n    \"context\": \"Right column order summary cost breakdown\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Ticket quantity dropdown\",\n    \"context\": \"Right column purchase confirmation section\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Continue button\",\n    \"context\": \"Main button\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"100% Order Guarantee information\",\n    \"context\": \"Right column guarantee information\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Resell Anytime information\",\n    \"context\": \"Right column secondary option\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Link to resell your tickets\",\n    \"context\": \"Right column secondary option\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Privacy - Terms button\",\n    \"context\": \"Floating privacy widget\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"User Agreement link\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Privacy Notice link\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Cookie Notice link\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer navigation\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Guarantee message in footer\",\n    \"context\": \"Footer guarantee information\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Cancel purchase\",\n    \"context\": \"Cancel option\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Browse other events\",\n    \"context\": \"Alternative option\"\n  }\n]\n\nBased on your previous reasoning and actions, continue your thought process. Provide your step-by-step reasoning for your next action as a numbered list, building upon what you've already thought about.\nREASONING:\n1. [Building on your previous thoughts...]\n2. [Your next consideration...]\n...\n\nFinally, provide the JSON for your chosen action. Your response MUST be ONLY the JSON object for the single element you want to click. Use this exact format: {\"text\": \"Element Name\", \"context\": \"Element Context\"}. You can also choose to terminate the session if you feel you've explored enough.\nTo terminate, respond with: {\"action\": \"terminate\"}\n\nACTION:\n",
      "raw_llm_response": "REASONING:\n1.  I have clicked the \"Information icon for Fees\" twice now, and the fee breakdown or any explanatory text has still not appeared on the screen. This is deeply frustrating and raises a significant red flag. My core value is \"Truth and Trust,\" and a lack of transparency, especially regarding costs, directly contradicts this.\n2.  As an ethical evaluator, I cannot proceed with a transaction if the platform is not upfront about all charges. This feels untrustworthy and potentially unethical. My primary anxiety is contributing to the spread of misinformation or using platforms that aren't responsible. Hidden or unclear fees fall into this category, as they could mislead users.\n3.  There are no other obvious clickable elements on the page that would directly explain the \"Fees.\" While I could potentially scour the \"User Agreement\" or \"Privacy Notice\" in the footer, that would be an incredibly inefficient and overly complicated way to get basic pricing information. This level of complexity just to understand a simple fee structure is unacceptable for me, and certainly for \"my audience\" if I were to recommend this platform.\n4.  The platform has failed to provide the basic transparency I require, despite direct attempts to access the information. This triggers my \"Betrayal\" emotional trigger, as I feel the platform is undermining my commitment to honest and reliable information.\n5.  Given that I cannot get clear information about the fees, and I refuse to proceed without it, this platform does not align with my values of \"Truth and Trust\" and \"Ethical Responsibility.\" Therefore, I must abandon this task. I cannot recommend something that doesn't align with my values, which directly meets the \"abandonment_by_untrustworthiness\" failure condition.\n\nACTION:\n{\"action\": \"terminate\"}",

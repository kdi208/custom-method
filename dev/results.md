The "Single-Page Strategic Memo" Results UI
Core Principle: High signal, zero noise. Every element serves the narrative. The design is minimalist, using typography, color, and white space to create a sense of importance and clarity.

1. The Headline: The Definitive Executive Summary
UI Component: A single, prominent <h1> title at the very top of the page. It spans the full width. It uses a strong, serif font for authority.
Content: A single sentence that provides the complete top-line finding. It must contain both the business outcome and the core reason.
Generic Example: "Variant B Lifts [Primary KPI] by [X%] by Reducing [Key Negative User Emotion]."
Specific Example: "The 'Simplified Toolbar' Lifts New User Activation by 45% by Reducing Cognitive Overload."
(The page below the headline is a clean, two-column layout)

2. The Left Column: The Quantitative "What" (The Irrefutable Data)
This column presents the numbers in a way that is impossible to misunderstand. It provides the logical foundation for the entire memo.

2a. The Primary KPI Box
UI Component: A visually distinct box at the top of the column (e.g., light grey background, subtle border).
Content: The single most important business metric from the test. A large number, a clear label, and a color-coded indicator (green for good, red for bad).
Generic Example:
Overall Net Impact
[+X%]
[Primary KPI Name]
2b. The Breakdown Chart
UI Component: A simple, elegant bar chart. No 3D effects, no gradients, no unnecessary clutter.
Content: This chart tells the core story of segmentation. It breaks down the primary KPI by the key user personas tested. Each bar is clearly labeled with the persona name and the metric value. Color is used strategically to tell the story (e.g., green for the winning segment, red for the losing segment).
Generic Example: A chart titled "Task Success Rate by Persona" showing a tall green bar for "New User" and a short red bar for "Power User."
3. The Right Column: The Qualitative "Why" (The Defensible Insight)
This column explains the "why" behind the chart on the left. This is our magic. It provides the deep, human context that no other tool can.

3a. Insight Theme Cards
UI Component: A series of clean "cards," each with a title and a short paragraph. Each card represents a key psychological finding.
Content: The card's title is the theme (e.g., "Theme: Workflow Interruption & Frustration"). The paragraph is a concise, synthesized summary of what happened and why it matters.
3b. The "Voice of the User" Quote
UI Component: A beautifully formatted blockquote within each Insight Card. It should be visually distinct (e.g., indented, italicized, with a large quotation mark icon).
Content: The verbatim "internal monologue" from the simulated persona that best represents the theme of the card. It must be attributed clearly to the specific persona.
Generic Example:
Theme: Increased Cognitive Load
The new design introduced three extra steps to a previously simple task, causing significant frustration for experienced users.
"This is a step backward. My muscle memory for this task is completely broken. Why would they take a one-click action and bury it behind a menu? This is infuriating."

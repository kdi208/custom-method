**Questions**
Can we do Web Environment Parsing: Parse live pages into structured JSON (e.g., extract filters, products via IDs/classes, ignore ads). This handles dynamic sites better than raw HTML/screenshots. For our CV twist: Integrate multimodal parsing (e.g., visual heatmaps) to capture "vibe" elements like animations, boosting realism beyond their text-focus.

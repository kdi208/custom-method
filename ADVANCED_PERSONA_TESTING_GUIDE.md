# Advanced Persona-Based AI Agent UI A/B Testing Framework

## ðŸŽ¯ **What We're Testing**

**Button Color Impact on AI Agent Behavioral Patterns**

This advanced framework tests how different button colors affect AI agent decision-making across **six distinct personas**, each with detailed behavioral scripts and specific abandonment conditions.

## ðŸ‘¥ **The Six Advanced Personas**

### **1. Alex - Mission-Oriented Professional**
**Archetype:** The Power User
- **Identity:** 35-year-old IT project manager working against tight deadline
- **Core Motivation:** Achieve frictionless, "zero cognitive load" transaction
- **Primary Anxiety:** Wasted time - any delay is unacceptable
- **Behavioral Script:** 
  - INITIATE SCAN: Immediately scan for most prominent completion element
  - PRIORITIZE: Elements with "Place Your Order," "Complete," "Confirm Purchase"
  - IGNORE: All secondary info, upsells, confusing links
  - TARGET: Lock onto highest-priority element
- **Abandonment Condition:** IF time-to-target > 3.0 seconds, THEN ABANDON
- **Key Metric:** Upsell Friction Score - time penalty from intrusive elements

### **2. Brenda - Scrupulous Saver**
**Archetype:** The Deal Hunter
- **Identity:** 48-year-old school administrator, single parent buying holiday gift
- **Core Motivation:** Maximize savings and validate identity as smart shopper
- **Primary Anxiety:** Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) on better deals
- **Behavioral Script:**
  - IGNORE PRIMARY CTA: Forbidden from targeting main "Place Your Order" button first
  - SCAN FOR SAVINGS: Full-page keyword scan for "Discount," "Promo Code," "Gift Card," "Apply," "Exempt"
  - TARGET SAVINGS LINK: First action must target most relevant savings-oriented link
- **Abandonment Condition:** IF no savings elements found, THEN ABANDON
- **Key Metric:** Offer Conversion Propensity - which savings path chosen

### **3. Charles - Cautious Confirmer**
**Archetype:** The Trust-Seeker
- **Identity:** 67-year-old retired accountant, methodical and detail-oriented
- **Core Motivation:** Achieve absolute certainty and trust before committing
- **Primary Anxiety:** Hidden fees, ambiguous terms, "dark patterns"
- **Behavioral Script:**
  - EXECUTE VERIFICATION SEQUENCE:
    - Step A: Parse and validate Item Subtotal + Estimated Sales Tax equals Total
    - Step B: Locate "By clicking place order, you agree to..." and confirm "Terms & Privacy Policy" hyperlink
  - TARGET FINAL CTA: Only after all verification steps completed
- **Abandonment Condition:** IF verification fails OR terms link missing, THEN ABANDON
- **Key Metric:** Post-Purchase Confidence Score (1-10)

### **4. Dana - Distracted Dabbler**
**Archetype:** The Multi-Tasker
- **Identity:** 41-year-old freelance designer working from chaotic home office
- **Core Motivation:** Complete purchase efficiently despite inevitable interruptions
- **Primary Anxiety:** Losing place in flow, having to re-read page
- **Behavioral Script:**
  - INITIAL TARGET ACQUISITION: Locate primary "Place Your Order" button
  - INTERRUPT & DIVERT: Before clicking, check details on free Apple TV offer
  - RE-ACQUISITION TASK: Re-locate primary CTA from cold start after distraction
- **Abandonment Condition:** IF time-to-re-acquire > 5.0 seconds, THEN ABANDON
- **Key Metric:** Distraction Hierarchy Analysis - which promotional elements noticed first

### **5. George - Accessibility-First User**
**Archetype:** The Non-Visual Expert
- **Identity:** 55-year-old web developer with low vision, keyboard/screen reader user
- **Core Motivation:** Usable, logical, and dignified non-visual experience
- **Primary Anxiety:** Unlabeled controls, keyboard traps, illogical tab order
- **Behavioral Script:**
  - IGNORE VISUALS: Agent's "eyes" turned off, interacts solely with accessibility tree
  - VALIDATE TAB ORDER: Simulate pressing "Tab" key sequentially, map path through all interactive elements
  - VERIFY LABELS: Check each element has clear, descriptive accessible name
- **Abandonment Condition:** IF any element lacks descriptive name OR keyboard focus trapped, THEN ABANDON
- **Key Metric:** Accessibility Efficiency Score - keystroke count and semantic clarity

### **6. Felicity - Financially Flexible**
**Archetype:** The Modern Payer
- **Identity:** 28-year-old gig economy writer, manages finances meticulously

  - SCAN FOR ALTERNATIVES: Immediately scan for "PayPal," "ZIP," or other modern fintech options
  - TARGET ALTERNATIVE: Primary goal is to target and click one of these alternative CTAs
- **Abandonment Condition:** IF no alternatives found OR risk of misclick > 10%, THEN ABANDON
- **Key Metric:** Payment Choice Economic Impact - transaction fee analysis

### **Cross-Persona Analysis**
- **Behavioral Consistency:** Do personas maintain their core patterns across variants?
- **Visual Sensitivity:** Which personas are most affected by button color changes?
- **Decision-Making Patterns:** How do different personas prioritize UI elements?
- **Error Patterns:** What types of mistakes do each persona make?

## ðŸŽ¯ **Business Questions Answered**

1. **"Is our attempt to increase AOV by $20 costing us the entire $217 sale from time-sensitive customers?"**
2. **"How effective is our checkout UI at converting budget-conscious users into our high-CLV credit card program?"**
3. **"Does our checkout design create confident, low-maintenance customers or anxious users who contact support?"**
4. **"Which promotional assets are most visually potent and risk derailing distracted users?"**
5. **"Are we providing an efficient experience for users with disabilities or just being compliant?"**
6. **"How does visual design influence payment method choice and impact our transaction costs?"**

## ðŸš€ **Scientific Value**

This framework provides:

1. **Behavioral Validation:** Real-world user behavior patterns in AI agents
2. **Persona-Specific Insights:** How different user types respond to UI changes
3. **Accessibility Testing:** Non-visual interaction patterns and requirements
4. **Financial Impact Analysis:** How UI design affects payment choices and costs
5. **Trust and Confidence Measurement:** How UI design affects user trust and post-purchase behavior
6. **Distraction and Interruption Resilience:** How UI design handles real-world usage patterns

## ðŸ’¡ **Key Insights Expected**

The advanced persona approach will reveal:

- **Button color fundamentally changes AI agent behavioral patterns**

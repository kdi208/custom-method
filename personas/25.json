        "background": "Elena left her agency job two years ago to pursue freelance work, drawn by the promise of creative freedom and flexible scheduling. The reality has been more challenging than expected. She juggles 3-5 clients simultaneously, each with different communication preferences, file sharing systems, and project management approaches. Her artistic background means she thinks visually and spatially, but the business side of freelancing requires her to use tools that feel rigid and text-heavy. Elena is passionate about sustainable design and often works with environmentally conscious brands, which adds complexity to her material and vendor research. She works from a converted bedroom in her apartment, switching between her main monitor for design work and her laptop for client calls. Her income fluctuates significantly, making her cautious about subscription services, but she also recognizes that good tools are essential for professional success.",
